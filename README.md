# Inventory-Management-Java-School-Project-
A project I was working on for my java class that I plan to maybe update as I learn some better practices. 
This application is for a made up business that sells planes. It has several options upon loading in as to the selections the user can make. 
It has several areas that may not do much other than provide an output to the user the main purpose was just to show that I could get the 
user to navigate the application without having to run it over again. There is a "Plane selection tool" which gives the user a bunch of options
and allows the user to answer each question and based on their answer the program will suggest the plane they should buy, based on their answers.
There is also an inventory management section where given the password, which is "Password1" the manager of the company could manage the inventory.
They have the ability to add, remove, edit, and search for inventory. By default five planes are pre-loaded into the program. However they 
can be removed if the user desires.
